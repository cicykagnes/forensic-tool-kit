# forensic-tool-kit
There are several problems faced by the forensic department due to the
increasing number of cases and lack of time to investigate. To the best of our knowledge,
these problems have not been addressed in a single place. The past attempts were not
promising to solve all the problems of the policemen. Each had its own disadvantages.
Though there were several studies in the field a complete automating system has not yet been
developed. The forensic investigators have to manually draw realistic images of the suspects
and examine the database to find the person. Also, if the image is damaged the wrong person
might be accused. With all these problems in line, we have come up with a unique solution,
the Forensic assistant software. It is an AI based application for forensic experts. It has
provisions to create sketches by using its in builts facial features or by drawing the sketches
using the software that our software provides. It can easily draw sketch images and generate
realistic colored photos using deep learning technology. The software identifies the victim
and helps in retrieving information regarding the identified person from the database. Also, it
provides provisions to complete the damaged images. With all these features, this software
automates a bunch of tasks and hence the forensic experts can easily make decisions during
the critical solution and save a lot of time.

# Components of the app:
1. Login portal
2. Drawing tool using react
3. drag and drop features of the face(eg. eyes, nose,..) to create a face sketch
4. Face sketch to photorealistic image generation using GAN
5. Face recognition and displaying the details of the identified person(eg. name, address, age, ..) using Facenet and SQL
6. Face Reconstruction of damaged Face image using GAN
